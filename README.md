# Insider Analysis
## Description
The repository consists of a jupyter notebook, multiple pickle machine learning models and a streamlit application. This application can be run locally. The user can enter information about a stock, like growth rate, operrating margin, etc. and the model will output if the stock will significantly out- or underperform the market (or neither). The model has been trained with stocks that had insider buys with more than 200k $. Its a classification model to identify whether a stock will out- or underperform by more than +-50%.
